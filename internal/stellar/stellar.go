// Package stellar wraps the Stellar RPC and transaction-assembly work SoroForge
// needs, behind interfaces that can be mocked.
//
// The boundary is deliberately narrow and string-shaped: Client speaks
// base64-encoded XDR envelopes rather than SDK structs, so a fake needs no XDR
// plumbing to stand in for a live network. Everything that interprets XDR —
// building operations, assembling simulated transactions, deriving contract IDs
// — is a pure function in this package and is tested without any network at all.
//
// Verified against github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk v0.7.1. The concrete
// implementation lives in rpc.go and is the only file that should need to
// change when the SDK moves.
