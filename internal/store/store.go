// deployments is an append-only log of every deploy and upgrade.
//
// Everything is namespaced by network. A contract alias means nothing on its
// own; "counter on testnet" and "counter on mainnet" are separate records with
// separate lifecycles, and no query in this package crosses that boundary
// implicitly.
